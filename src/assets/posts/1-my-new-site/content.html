I'm excited to launch my new personal website, which is built from modern JavaScript frameworks. I switched from WordPress because of the ease of customizability and the low cost of hosting on AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud. Two main benefits I got from AWS:  (1) HTTPS (a lock sign next to my URL) is free via their certification manager for secure data transmission,  and (2) cheap Content Delivery Network (CDN) service for lighting fast load times from anywhere in North America and Europe. I'm 100% using client side scripting, so I won't be getting the full benefits of SEO, however, my goal isn't to generate leads from the web (at least not yet). If you need a highly customized website like mine within 2-3 weeks, send me an email. Remember, using out of the box solution is easy but lacks the personal touch one needs to showcase their true personal brand.
